// this is my code

void main() {
  
   const a = 50;
  const b = 25;
  //this for addition
  int x = a+b;
  print('Addition is = $x');
  
  //this for subtraction
  int y = a-b;
  print('Subtraction is = $y');
  
  //this for multiplication
  int z = a*b;
  print('Multiplication is = $z');
  
  //this for division
  double w = a/b;
  print('Division is = $w');
  
  //This for Modulus 
  int u = a%b;
  
  print('Modulus is = $u');
  
  
}
// And This is the Output


Addition is = 75
Subtraction is = 25
Multiplication is = 1250
Division is = 2
Modulus is = 0
